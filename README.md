Your task:

Strict Rules:
- DO NOT include vague or generic tags like "apparel", "clothing", "Unknown", "Not sure" unless there's truly no better match.
- Ensure each "Product Name" is unique.
- Do NOT repeat items even if wording differs.
- Prioritize specific brand/product over general category.

Return your result in clean raw JSON, no markdown, no comments. Format strictly as:

    {
      "Product Name": "JDT 2024 Home Shirt",

## âœ… Best Practices

- Ensure all product images are clear, close-up, and free from excessive noise.
- Avoid uploading watermarked or blurred images for better AI results.
- Maintain a curated list of taxonomy terms under `product_tags` to ensure consistent tagging.
- Use **Re-analyze** only when needed to reduce OpenAI token usage.
- Always validate AI output and edit manually if needed.
